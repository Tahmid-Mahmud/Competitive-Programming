Goldbach's Conjecture is one of the oldest unsolved problems in number theory.

It says:

"Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers."

✨ Examples:
4 = 2 + 2

6 = 3 + 3

8 = 3 + 5

10 = 5 + 5 or 3 + 7

28 = 11 + 17 or 5 + 23

This has been tested for trillions of even numbers, and no counterexample has ever been found — but no one has proved it formally yet, so it’s still a conjecture, not a theorem.

🤔 Is There a Version for Odd Numbers?
Yes — an extended version often used in programming problems:

Any integer n ≥ 5 can be expressed as the sum of 3 prime numbers.

This is useful because:

If n is even and ≥ 4, Goldbach's conjecture (2 primes)

If n is odd and ≥ 5, you can write:
n = 3 + (n - 3) → If n - 3 is even and ≥ 2, then it's the sum of two primes → total 3 primes

✅ Why It's Useful in Your Problem
In your toy coin problem:

You have infinite coins of any prime value.

So if n ≥ 2, you can always pay the exact amount using primes:

If n is a prime → pay with that single coin.

If not:

Even n ≥ 4 → sum of 2 primes

Odd n ≥ 5 → sum of 3 primes (like 3 + sum of 2 primes)

Only n = 1 is impossible — there's no way to reach 1 using any combination of primes.

📌 Summary
n	Can be formed with primes?	Reason
1	❌ No	No primes add to 1
2, 3	✅ Yes	Prime itself
≥ 4	✅ Yes	Goldbach / Extended Goldbach Conjecture
